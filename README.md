## Application of a genetic algorithm for travel optimization

The engineering thesis aimed to analyze the influence of changes in genetic algorithm parameters and the methods employed within it on the outcome. To accomplish this, both the traveling salesman problem and the knapsack problem were examined. The necessary computations to fulfill the aforementioned objectives were conducted using the <a href="https://www.cyfronet.pl/komputery/18486,artykul,superkomputer_ares.html">Ares</a> supercomputer.
